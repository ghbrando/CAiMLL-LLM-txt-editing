                "content": "Naval X Weekly Team update for 08 October 2024 We're into the first week of our new fiscal year and things off to a running start here. OK, that's just a few offices and highlights that we got going on here.Of course, I think we talked about some of these last week on our Christmas party, 07 December. If you want to go and buy your tickets, there's a link for it right there.The federal holidays that we got coming up. And of course, don't forget about voting day as well. It's been there in November.Submarine Grand Prize Challenge will update on that. So that's still up and running. NRL is in the lead. We're supporting NRL and I talked last week with captain Matt Luff, he is the PMS 396 which is the submarine ballistic submarine in service office.And and he's executing and running the he's the O 6 basically who's overseeing the Tang.Efforts going on, so they have a tank team with Johns Hopkins who's out going through and asking questions and looking at the processes of how we do shipyard.Maintenance and how and how do we bring the ships in this to the to the to the submarines, into the dry dock and then out of the dry dock and all the processes for the work packages and all that kind of stuff. And is there some way to streamline all that from a process perspective also other technologies that can be potentially used to help with that process?Right. And and so that first I think output from John Hopkins is going to be the 28th and 29th of John Hopkins APL and either myself and or the captain will be attending that because anything they come up with at this point it's on the for the submarine side can probably be leveraged against the surface Navy side as well. And how would you go about doing our maintenance packages and what not, although there's a huge difference between the submarine maintenance package.Does things with the hole in the in the surface Navy package that does things with the hole. As you can imagine, right, you get a crack in the submarine hall. That's not a good thing. But you know, a lot of times we just keep hanging over the rust in a, in a, in a, in a, you know, in a surface Navy ship until it goes through and then we put a plate and Weld the plate on there and we're good so.So there definitely is a difference between the two. All right. So that's what's going on with that and it's just moving forward.It's three different submarine things going on. One is vitamin Gaucher. It's this question was, hey, I need to get my submarine out of the shipyards, out of the dry dioxide and out of the dry docks quicker. Apparently there's a huge backup right now where they they have submarines waiting and once you for the submarine Navy, if you can't do the whole inspections of a certain periodicity, you basically get your whole decertified. You can't submerge right And and so there's.Literally waiting and been waiting for a year plus that are decertified these days. So this is a pretty critical problem. There's also another couple other.Submarine problems are being the two other different ones that are being asked above of FC and R as well and the greater Navy basically. And that's that the O&R is trying to support science is going on with the submarine Grand Prize challenge and what's going on and, and how and, and the various aspects of that.All right, so end of your performance reviews are up, everybody is an owing. Our employee should have got the end of year evaluations turned in either to their supervisor and or delivered into the the YAR program and submitted to their supervisor. If you haven't done that I would get I would encourage you to do that ASAP so that you will be issues with the admin.Let's see.National election, of course, as soon as everybody knows about political activities and what you can and cannot do, so we deliver that. I would encourage everybody to vote.And let's see on our portfolio council, OK, so these are owner has several.Different processes they go through within, within O&R determined you know what, what F&C is they going to go after, what INPS are going to be selected in the processes for those type of things. So that's the portfolios.And then, and then there's regular reviews with the Admiral with with owner Global Naval XI PR 51, which is the SAP programs. And so these portfolio councils come up here periodically. They go to capture those topics and then go through those processes basically. So that's the next one's coming up on November. I'm not exactly sure what the topic is that one is right now, but we thought, we thought interesting case and if we're interested.And we will find out what it is as we get, as we get closer.All right. Any questions about highlights and anything you've heard that I haven't got on here that you need to invite to bring up with the group?OK. Next slide. OK. So priorities pretty much remain the same as they were last week?Our PPRR was rescheduled to 21 October. That's going to be a little bit of a problem since the 21 October is the.Off site and it is a database flying to Newport for our PMR. So this may change and or if it doesn't, then the cash is going to be the off site and I'm going to be at the PRR supporting that. We have to divide and conquer before we fly out of Monday night. So that's the that's what the game plan that that's going on.Alright, So I had a great discussion last week with Jamie Thompson, who is the head of contacting authority for ONR about CS, OS and BA, AS and our contracting strategy within with Naval X and I went through all of our contracts and what we're doing and how we're doing it, why we're doing it with him in the general agreement. Overall, there's been a lot of talk about.DIUCSO process and how do we do a?Navy or Naval X process that is true to that DUI process and can leverage how they do that. And Mr. Thompson turns out is a is is really familiar with CSO. He's worked with him in the past. He really likes him a lot and he wants to us to explore how do we, if we wanted to do CS OS, he liked us to do them through the O&R organization.And, and he would like to go through and understand, hey, how can we do his?The day the Csos with within O&R, we've been staying true to this DIU process as well. Let's explore those processes to do that.And Robert, you got a question."

You know, with with this also comes the the PS stuff and cooperative agreement. You know, there's a there's a whole bunch of these non far based stuff that can go with the agreements officer.Was there any appetite to to having a dedicated agreements officer and some contract specialists to just support Naval X?"

And then I think after we articulate that actually start doing that direction, I think then that will flow from flow down that will actually occur to get something aligned to us. But for now code 254 is the branch that does these type of contracts.They also do they do all the all the non services contracts in that branch. So OTAs sivers.Regular fire contracts, the BAA contracts and things like that, so.We did talk about that and then basically he's asking us and asking me what is our demand signals and and 25 and 26 and out."

And I would say I don't know because I haven't we haven't done the actual apples apples comparison of hey. So the next step basically is to get in there with him and again with with with Nataki and say, OK, here's the process and that we're doing with DIU.To the processes, step one, Step 2, Step 3. And I kind of went through that process with him, you know, kind of at the high, high level to say, hey, this is what they're doing. And, and we want to make, we want to go this through this with your, with your team and, and see if there's anything in here that you can't do right. And where are the hang ups for that? And then if you can, you say if you're like, yeah, the thumbs up and let's go do it and then let's try it out. And he's, he was very admirable to that."

                "content": "Yeah, I'll give them 3030 seconds overview of what what I see the differences are of what owner put out versus DIU. The owner solicitation looks a lot like a BAA type type solicitation with an OTA at the end.It includes industry days. It includes.A demonstration that companies have to pay for to show up to all in competition for a final award at the end of the 12 to 18 months and then it creates essentially a BAA type activity where multiple performers get awards. The via IU process is commercially based. Also ends up with an OTA award but is a lot more flexible and is much more lightweight with the focus on.Lowering the various entry for commercial entities, which means that they're focused on small, small applications, limiting government specific language using commercial type contracts and speed and reduction of cost to to award and so while both of the CS OS processes are valid.The VIU process has a tendency to bring in performers that would not normally do business with DoD because the various entry.Over."

So I would say in response to that, what we did talk, I did talk to him about was that specifically and he said the CSO process you want to use is what is is based on what you want to do. And he says that was they did that because that's what the customer the.Code they were doing that for was asking for, and they set that up for that. So we come in with a different ask and a different way of doing it then he's willing to.Customize it, tailor it to what we want, OK."

He's former Navy. So if there's any further questions or differentiate yours, you need, he'll be an asset and is standing by."

                "content": "How's that? OK, so we got a little bit of a journey to go on this and we'll get there.All right. Also this is a side thing that is talking about the BA as with him as well and it's definitely a contract contracting vehicle that we want to explore and see how we can use as well. the BA as are extremely flexible too. And the difference between I would articulate the way I would describe the CSO and the BAA because they're very similar. One ACSO leads to an OTA award.And but in ABAA.Can lead to an OTA award, a fire contract award or a grant award. And so they can be all three. One, if ACSO is primarily used. If you don't exactly know what company you want to go with or what technology, what's out there and so you're doing a commercial solutions kind of advertisement. I'm looking for something and, and, and, and tell you show me what you got.But as ABA can be directed basically, so I can go, hey, I got family company, I know what I want. I go, hey, apply for the BAA and then I work with that company in the government entity to build a package that gets awarded to them, right. So it's, it's the different type of tools and different types of things. We're trying to now understand all those things together.To combine them with with all the other things we also have to like our detect contracts that we have and put that acquisition strategy together and in a in a process flow of what we can use and when we would use it and how we would use it. And and the time is right now to kind of now get into an art explorer. How do we deleverage these things with inside over not because I know they do BA as in O&R about anywhere between 3:00 to five months and I talked to different awardees that have been awarded in that, so that amount of time.And so they came to it pretty quickly and then the Otai don't imagine it should be any different in terms of timeline as well. OK.All right, Culture campaign moving out on that strategy, Dave's and Ronnie working hard on that. If you got inputs for them or anything you can help them with, please do reach out to them.On our web page is still in works as we edit that. This is the internal ONR website that has not been updated for a little while, not the external one that we have on the 2nd website.This let's see, we are, we're still working. We got the off site coming up here on the 21st for the next iteration of the slow metrics.That we're working across M&R and and so this week.Nominee can have been with all their flow and their metrics and and processes and things that they're doing for IOSM work. And so now we are connecting that with and laying that with the slow 3 metrics as well and doing that mapping. I don't know if everybody has seen that. I think they know are you are you planning to like get those out to the tech first directors or has been sent out to them? Just take a look at that process or.And we get their inputs. What's your thoughts on that?"

Let's see here.The database of the line problem. So that's the captains database and he'd like to have something in his back pocket. It shows, hey, here are the problems they hear the technology we think are aligning those problems. So CUI level type of slider 2 for him as he wants to carry his back pocket. That's what he's hopefully it'll fall out if you do this work also with the playbook, which we got some brass coming this month here in October.And I'm not certain if we'll have anything ready to show at the PMR.I was going to ask Ray. Ray, do you know if we're going to have a draft of that thing at the PMR just to like let people look at?And Rick Joint today."

And then the newsletter, we had a discussion this past week about the newsletter and and and the cat party, but he's thinking about how do we get get more distro on that and how do we get and what kind of destroy he's looking for? And so we'll touch base with him when he gets back off of the and finalize some of that thought.All right. Any questions about priorities?Great contract discussion.OK, next.OK. This is where we're going and where we're headed to in the next few weeks, the National Security Venture Capital Summit with Cyberworks, which is an Air Force group that sort of does other innovation stuff and that's behind the Colorado Springs. I'll be attending that for the Naval X team. And I think I'm on a panel out there talking about rapid innovation, rapid capability or something like that. I got to get all set up for that.And let's see the the 21st is the is the the sloe off site?And I was just sent an e-mail around yesterday, I think that the Cataract employees are out there, out in Tech Bridges and the Tech bridge directors. So you're aware that that's what that's happening at Hard Rock, that's all.Let's see N 94 PR the 21st right now, but that's TVDI couldn't get me that's going to get rescheduled most likely. And then our PMR, we have people coming to the PMR that are outside Naval X just so you know there's expect that one of them is an O&R employee who works within the the areas of of O&R of exploitation demonstration.And transitioning of technologies and wants the company to hear what we got to say. So just be aware of that. You might see those in the registration, no."

But yeah, I've had discussions with several folks that can't.It up, but I don't want to make it. I don't want people not to travel because they have a virtual option right. And I want we need the cat wants to have as many people there in person as possible because it's really a team building event as much as it is as an information event as well. And and just because we are all scattered and we all are all over the place and running around at 200 miles an hour going to meetings all over the country all the time. We're such a distributed force who I workforce that it's nice to get together in person.But for Julie and Linda, if you're online, let's explore getting a virtual teams link that we can use for people who can't get up there. I have a couple people I know like like Gustavo Rivera, new technical director. He's because he's brand new and he didn't know about it beforehand is and he's got some family things. He's got to be home for that particular week. So he needs a virtual.Virtual link. So those kind of those kind of conditions we're looking for.Eric Gardner, over to you."

We thought it would be really good to have them invited, would be a great touch point and I think having them in person would be extraordinary, but certainly as a Teams invite option would probably be.Useful for them as well as our PF partners.But in advance of that, seeing the agenda would be also helpful so that we could kind of tie them in and and where they can go ahead and you know, reserve time on the calendars during that week so that they can dial in for those specific areas of most interest to them over."

If they want to participate, I think that would be a good essay for them. Gus. Yeah, yeah. Good morning, Scott and Eric. Yeah, I'm one of the Arpades actually. So, so I can I will reach out to my community and and and send out the invitation to them. In fact, I'm going to be transitioned over to our weekly at 11 here in a couple of minutes. So I'll bring this.But you got me right, one of the things I want to do is one of the biggest things I want to do is how to align the armpits and transitioning, scaling, fielding of tech right, including experimentation and demonstration to naval X in the iOS team. And how do we help the broader NRDE community, right? That's one of the big things I'm going to I'm going to do with the Lego expert is our fed and it's the.TD Yeah, I think one of the things that we talked about with Doctor Seidel and you with Dad's under 18 E and actually I meant to mention something when we were talking to him as a PCDA couple weeks ago, we were talking about a talking to him was.Years ago, Bill Bray said to me.Hey, the orphids are like are like an extension of of the organization basically in some ways, and I think that's kind of the mindset we should take into this as well. They're very helpful and very handy and can then be a very drive things for us and there are expertise essentially into the war percentage right Those that that is our the Admiral says to us, how are you degrading your how do you grade your homework there, captain the varsity. Then the answer is, oh, I got all these are big guys refund me the right sneeze across the war percentage and we're going to do that for us.Right. That's that's the kind of thing you want to connect, you want to have with them. And so the answer the second part of that question real quickly, Eric.The the agenda is in the link on the web page that that where you register and so the the official agenda. So is so Linda, how do we do we do we have to have the password on that thing?'Cause I feel like remember the password right?"

And then we'll work to, to manage kind of the, the, the teams.Virtual sign in for for the event itself and try to cover as much as we can. But whether you're tending in person or virtual, you have to register. And Eric just put the, the, the LinkedIn, the, the, the chat there. But we'll, we'll get that updated and pushed.

Remember the password and everything else that goes with that. Then people can send it around to the people who would who wanted to just jump in here and there and then we could if they want to join us, then we can give them a password for that."

So if you have not gotten that template from me, please let me know I'll I'll resend it but I there is an ask that you fill out those quad charts and return them to to us collectively 401 tech bridge and me so we.Put those all together and have them all keyed up for rapid fire presentation on Tuesday pretty much all day. And then I won't speak for you, but there's also a quad chart for the IOSM Pilot that I know distributed and asked that those be filled out and returned ahead of time. So again, I think that's all now Wednesday's agenda that will go through the iOS and Pilot and, and and give up these on the quad charts. So there were a couple of asks there as well that we're asking folks to.Those quads returning to us in advance of the meeting starts. And then the last thing for me is, as you all I believe know, we've got a tour of Newport scheduled for Monday afternoon, the 21st. For those who are traveling in time to join us. I think it's a 1300 kickoff. We've got a few people registered, but I would encourage anyone else who wants to join us for a tour of Newark to get visit requests in.As soon as possible, we're starting to run short on time. We want to give our security focused to to process visit requests and nobody gets stranded outside the gates.So if you have any questions on that, please let me know over."

So we're working with Gus.Umm, Gus Martinez, our innovation operating support Manager out there to coordinate that brief, he's going to be meeting with Joe Root just to get a sense of the equities and kind of how we should tailor that brief. On the six six side, there are USAI funds that are going to be expiring in December. And so we're working closely with Tron and with Pink utility to identify some relevant capabilities that can be facilitated through the a detailed pathway. So working that actively is more to fall there on the Task Force 59.We've got a final demo of the Anello X3 IMU integrated on a CSAT going on today in San Diego.Assuming that all goes well there, we will be taking Hank hearing 2 assets over to five, nine in theater for them to exercise in a truly GPS denied environment and get OQE in theater. So hopefully everything goes well today and that pans out. We're also, I think I mentioned we're sending up a couple of assets to Newark.To support some OQE environmental testing for lightweight and heavyweight torpedo programs.On the Group four side, I was out at Little Creek last week of Norfolk, met with the Commodore there. Captain Green had a really good productive exchange. He's very pleased with the partnership to date and the success to date with the so far buoy. We highlighted it was somewhat of an overview of Mabel X and then the lines of business and then specifically diving into iOS and the partnership that we have there. But we're able to highlight not just the great partnership and teaming that Group 4 has provided to us, but also the.Capabilities and opportunity that Naval X facilitate so highlighted the temperature network how Gulf Coast was also involved with Gulf Coast tech bridge was also involved with the buoys and just SIBOR and T2 and culture campaign just really gave an overview and he he seemed to be very impressed his team afterward.Praised the the engagement and the collaboration that we've had today. So all good things there and to come to our also sent a a direct note to Captain Izarski emphasizing that so all good there. We also they also have through the customer team. So J Galvin the iOS sub for Group 4.And Joanne Pilcher, the Techbridge Network liaison affiliated with that customer team are coordinating an industry event to bring forth the industry potential industry partners to report. Other than that, we are exercising the iOS process and the metrics. So again, if you haven't received that, let us know. We'll make sure you get access to it. But we're going to take two betas. I think that we're going to run through the the step by step of the discover phase and just get some empirical data to inform how we can further find the.The process and the associated intertwined performance metrics, prepping for PMR on leave next week. And then if we do have a minute and Sam Peterson is on, I'm not sure Sam, if you're on, but he was out with Kathy Zarski last week in Washington with the Armada team and that went well. Sam, if you're on, do you want to just give a quick like one or two lines of how that went?"

So Alan Yeager was out at the trip with us. He can also speak to this, but they are interested in pursuing a separate use case for Armada.To automate the PET process for a system they have on board called the All Digital Receiver.Sounds like that is actually moving forward probably probably have our model on contract within the next two to three weeks.

So that was very informative and.And along with with Sam, on the 2nd of October we had a Coastal Trident tech talk.And we're prepping, you know, for the quarterly, all three of us will be there and we're working on our slides on that. And so the, the big event we're having this month is on the 28th of October, we're having an NCMS tech talk and networking event. So that's the tech talks in the afternoon followed by a networking event on the rooftop. I believe that's been sent out across all the tech bridges. So the tech talk part is virtual and or in person. So if you're interested in attending that, please do register. I don't really want to take away too much of.Because we'll be discussing it when we when we're in at the quarterly. But I was going to call out the event that we're having with Jason. So that's the worst. I believe it's the 30th of the 31st, I can't remember quite off the top of my head. So another initiative that we've been looking at is how to increase our our STEM events in our coordinations through the tech bridge given that we have.Three Warfare Center groups here.And we're all either detachments or subordinates to some, some master 1. Gerald has really been working on that to and and we're looking to set up a meeting with like the stem POC's across the local.Detachments here and and see how we can collaborate better on that and I'll tell you from from my warfare centers perspective they were very excited to to do that and then the last thing here Oh yeah I forgot about this we're having code 34 come down and brief us so.Chris, is it Sunny Santee? Chris Santi is coming down on the 28th as well. So he's going to come down and we'll have a brief with him in the morning and he's staying for the MCMS event. If you recall, I went up there and briefed at their All Hands in August, I believe so. So that's what I have at least. Gerald, you want to chime in on anything else I missed?"

Understanding more about our Tech Bridge ecosystem as well as the FRC.East specifically as well as stations are the host stations that are Marine Corps fishing Cherry Point. So working details on that event there. Secondarily, we're from extend perspective, we are working on our annual Stimulav competition event. We're having our kickoff meeting with the high school kids in the month of like mid November at our Tech Bridge location as well too.Also from a.Contract perspective, we had a a down selection of a a capability requirement for one of our program officers at the program officers about a year or so ago. Took a little bit of time because we had to switch companies. But we got a contract awarded for prototype of a tool to be used in the fleet. And if that is successful then we'll be working with the program off to get that fielded across the fleet depending on how they prototype.About, so that was directly from a tech bridge event that we hosted and had with down selection of various companies. Lastly, I will now just give an update for everyone. My replacement we interviews have been conducted, selection has been made, but we're waiting HR action.

So let me know if that's if that's a use in conjunction with that, that tech ecosystem there, that one being with a focus on advanced manufacturing and contested logistics also tied into the eastern regional range effort DIU is looking at.Maybe falling in on one of those facilities that we're working with?To have a on ramp hub established here in the southeastern region as well. So there's another DIU connection potentially with Naval X tied to that as well.Looking forward to the visit to Newark Newport, specifically in the virtualized virtualization space and the work that they're doing up there to learn more. We have an effort now underway in Charleston. It is just beginning.To create a virtualized amphib. So we are looking to start the virtualization of an Ampib platform to to support ongoing anti X events, other experimentation events and developmental efforts out in Iowa Atlantic. So we're hoping to follow in and leverage a lot of the work that I think Newark Newport has already done in virtualizing platforms. And so we're looking forward to.Learning more with that.I think.That's all I have for my update."

Vendor SOW has been sent to compliance review, then it'll go into legal down at ACC Orlando.Tech demos start three weeks after each award, and they should be fairly well aligned because they were kind of delivered all at once.The Deep Dice CRM sharing the effort is initially assigned with the DIU to lead the effort. Moving forward, the working group is going to be composed of DIU taking leads, supporting with efforts, Army and of course Naval X. Finalizing functional environment and testing requirements is kind of in process.They're, they're looking for cost capabilities to review and they're in the midst of assessments on that right now. DIU funding for the data mapping, normalization, tagging within the CRM sharing environment.Kind of in review for Naval X at the moment. On the sales force side of the coin, the Ato is still an E Math Step 5. It's still on track for October.Completion we are engaging with n-c.com final cyber guidelines and requirements and also on our own R for any MO as that are required should have some information on both of those in the next day or so. They will X has got officially delivered 120 licenses for Salesforce.That are available in the system. The availability of that will be pending.The the Ato and also we have a leadership review and overview schedule for them later on this week on the current capabilities and processes, digital teams finalizing on board guidelines, state and operating procedures, basic training and usage reviews and also some data loaded guidance to support people in getting their contacts and their briefs into the environment.The Experience Cloud site is finalizing a limited number of components. At the moment it's kind of just polishing things.Security improvements and validations, of course, continue contracts and purchase request application is currently in testing. We're working on initial load of data to validate automation and reporting. ERP access has been graded to the digital team. So they're taking a look at what can we do to kind of collect data and also make sure that it stays, you know, figure out what the processes are for maintaining currency on some of that stuff.And initial loads of some of that data is occurring for testing purposes.Support capabilities we're refining the notification workflows should be available within Ato verification validation processes continue on that assets management application is currently refining notification workflows and preparing to launch with the Ato. Initial loads of some active data for testing purposes and progress prototype slow metrics.Dashboard has been created. We've got initial builds of problem statement objects, activity objects and solution objects.Be related to each other for parting the reports that are necessary.Recommended discovery sessions to kind of formalize the workflows on that.Established needed properties and values that could fit within the framework that's there we can also of course modify the framework of components to add things that we need to and then of course updating. You know all that would just be automated to the slow metric dashboard within Salesforce based on various interactions. Cloud board 2 licenses were approved for midlane tech bridge. I think they're in routing right now for.Provisioning those users should have access to Cloud board currently.But the official license would need to be provisioned. I'll double check on that. Google was still waiting on our purchase license provisions to be applied to the name Alex. Google Account 7 licenses are currently available.And for some users, you know pending approval through the process.We have contacted the Rep to finalize the license provisioning in the environment playbook obviously is the PII CUI policy guidance is including the playbook and then review Black Pearl, we still got test order five in review and we need to sync with PO Digital at some point on.Some potential new tools to be loaded there. Arpoon was one of those that we've kind of identified as a priority. On the birdie side of the coin, the harpoon PRPR is in process. I did find out that the vendors been engaged with KHAKI for onboarding and sow estimates to close that cycle out. And then final thing is just the Naval X website team's been very busy and preparing for this.Salesforce launch to join our network pages for traditional and non traditional check boxes are still kind of pending discussion, but they're already in Salesforce for the launch.With that, those are kind of the major updates.
