Trent, I know that you are speaking with Paula.During the call. So we are tracking for that for Igniter as well. Start a studio. We have 7 technologies that have already been locked in for the program. We are also going to be under an updated timeline too and and so everything will still end in April prior to the summit. So there if there are any other updates that need to be made, we we can work.With that, the way that I made the.Updated schedule was to allow for.So I will, we've had about, we've had over 40 people apply for the program and over 30 of the people who have applied on they are very strong applicants. So I will begin to, to start doing the intake in the intake 'cause as early as next week, we have a handful of updated Flyers for the, for the technologies that we're we're able to, to share to the public. So I will have all of that.All of that available on Thursday and Tuesday of next week and then for accelerators still going through the applications. And so everything is live for, for that. If there are any startups that each of you know that that that you think would be a good fit for the program, feel feel free to direct them over to to us, but we are rocking and rolling on the back end and so.Those are my updates from our side and actually a quick note too, I was up at the Stanford Defcon on Tuesday and Wednesday of of this week just getting some more insights about the defense startup space too and sharing more about the work that that we are doing back back home. There were a couple of good pro pro tips that were shared.From some heavy hitters too from the conference as well. I think one of the most important highlights that I got that I shared with all of the studio teams is that in terms of providing technology to.A war fighter, for instance, make sure that you have inventory for it. And so that the, that piece that from any of the armed, any of the armed forces that, that are on here, they need years, not weeks of inventory. So that, that was one of the most kind of highlights I got from from the conference that I, I shared around with our studio alumni. So that that's it from from me. And then Nathan, I'll turn it back.Back over to you as you're the lead for the call. Hey, guys."
