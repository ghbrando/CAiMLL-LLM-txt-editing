So I think, I mean, we've talked in the past broadly speaking, once we get through the paperwork part, you know, kind of figuring out what would a first project be, Yeah, what's the use case you want to focus on 1st? So I figured a call early to kind of flesh that out, talk about what tools you might want to use for you. Once we once identify the use case, you know, we've got a few different pieces of software that would be relevant.To, you know, implementation and testing. A lot of that work can be done in advance of having a display at your disposal. I think when we talked in previous iterations, the idea is we at some point bring prototype stuff, you know, back into the area and figure out, you know, a week or two that people could sit and do, you know, test on it after the development.And so I think getting that first kickoff was kind of a, you know, big next step. I am transitioning a little bit into some new markets now. So all you'll probably be the main technical reference point. I'll be in the background and available, but it won't be in the lead.And so certainly they kind of driving it forward from there. But the other developments in parallel that have happened that will be relevant is we are going to have a facility at UCF Florida, right, with a big new Novak table by the end of the year and the latest. So there will be an opportunity to maybe do some of the work on that instead of or in addition to having the product that you've seen."

So separate department from what I initially thought, but I think that would be great to have eyes on there. Then maybe your latest and greatest can can experiment from their perspective. And then what my initial thought was ballistic missile reconstruction analysis and seeing that dimensionally holographically to be able to move.And all that stuff. So that's two use cases right now. Yeah, I'm thinking right off the bat and that's where I think Port Runini, Dahlgren, that's the three of us would be looking at it for each is ballistic missile. Yeah, yeah. And analysis."

So to get hit, bring in their perspective. So we may want to tinker together. Yeah, exactly. And I think I think we at least touched on before it would be worth making sure in that first sync up we just get straight would be, you know, the difference between if you can use notional data and right, you know, a non sensitive area and equipment versus trying to get Ato down the road.So you have."

And so we put the second one that UCF, but we're we're having a few more.And so one of them will be down probably in Silicon Valley. So if you want to and we'll have access to it and stuff.

Yeah, so.Like I've seen, I've seen things like, you know, you'll have these pretty complicated.Things in graph space that are actually three things.You know, visualizing that with different weightings or different emphasis, right, data, data points on a given node that can tell you more efficiently.
