That doesn't mean you have to print firestorm drones, but it means you have an additive capability to produce mass at the edge. And so we're basically funded. We've been around for a few years now. We're raising a Series A here. We're growing constantly, mostly on the engineering side.Recently, I was in Taiwan, but we've been all over the world. We have a system done in Eastern Europe. We've got a bunch of contracts with the Air Force. I've got a couple with O&R and we're kind of bouncing around. But we're, I think that shocker's narrowing down to a customer base that we can, you know, truly support. I think that's going to hopefully fall within one of the big services like the Navy and the Army. And so excited to talk to you, Troy. I think this is really nicely within.Navy's at least proposed efforts in the next couple years. Additive manufacturing is popular with the Navy also probably the Air Force that everyone knows what to do with it. But I think that as we look at, you know, support to ARS like into Paycom, we come with a really unique approach to U.S. market which is very crowded, but we've been able to distinguish ourselves over the past two years.In anything I'm missing man. So enter CTO just quick intros myself and Co founders.And then we have Bread VP of Business Development and Matt is really looking at holistic programs across the beauty.Did I? Did I cover it well enough for you again? And Fred, if you have the version of the deck man, I can run choices and highlights."

So we're able to produce mass anywhere and so.This is a manufacturing line, some just a 3D printer in a box. I know that's not very unique. We've had those for a few years, nice to 90s downrange. This is a true manufacturing line. So right now the mechs that we use actually extend out and give you 3 times the workspace climate control really production up in 48 hours. And so with aircraft right now the Group 2 that we're we're building, we actually are a transition to toolless assembly. We've removed components and parts of the past year.To make it to the user friendly as possible.Or payload agnostic and I'll show you in a couple subsequent slides how we're getting after that. But it is truly revolutionaries in the drone space. So I can stop here for any questions. Acxell, which is what we're on contract password to build out. We're actually transitioning to a funding increase for that that aren't the R&D funds we're doing with the app stock. And then the platforms themselves, really everyone's taking a look at them for missions from target drones to you know to depend our precision.Munitions as well as kind of EW tools and the agnostic space for payload."

So we kind of don't shout that from the mountaintops because it's a little bit specialized in what we're doing and we want to have as long of a head like a lead on the competition as we can. Understood. OK, thanks."

                "content": "Did you want to click on the slide for me? Not that you're a slide clicker, but you guys know why we're doing it. You know, we started our business because we're looking at smaller countries within themselves looking bigger ones. We're creating a strategic advantage, you know, for countries like Ukraine, Taiwan and you name the next one. And then also countries that can't afford ISRO, think about Central America, South America. So a lot of opportunity within the space. It's really only limited by your creativity. Next slide.This is what you guys know and the services seem to love it. They love paying $350,000 for a one way attack system.I say keep doing it. We'll just keep paying more taxes, but it takes five to six weeks to make one. And that's where we think we can be really powerful, not only going to be way more affordable, but we're going to make them faster. And so you know, we can get a bird flying in 48 hours. That's unheard of within the industry. And so we're proving it now daily. We we can produce mass for obviously we don't have the CapEx to build 1000 drones and put them in our warehouse and sell them 1 by 1.But we have the, we have the road map to get there and to create the strategic advantage and and the ARS that are they're pertinent to US discrepancy and then the big one here.This is what I can show you a body of work on is it usually takes two to three weeks to do hardware integrations and we prove that we can do it in 24 hours. And so we were working with a FLRI, which is information Directorate up in Rome, NY. They had a very specific and basically remote ATR system that they wanted to test out. We changed our fuselage, get the complete geometry and reprinted and it had it airborne in two days across the country. And so that's really changing how we test.In the USDA's as big sign as well. Do you have anything I'm missing on that one?No, I think the big thing take away here guys is like there's a way that people do things now and and it's been driven because of over optimization of engineering. And we just think that well not think we've proven that there's a different way. And it's much less expensive, much quicker to market and much easier to make changes to the vehicle because you're not locked to tooling like we're seeing here, right? This guy's holding, you know, resin infused carbon fiber into a mold.But what happens when that mold needs to change?Sometimes you can change molds, but a lot of times you got to go cut new mold, pour new mold, whatever it may be. We want to get away from that and into this new kind of area or arena of basically like the vehicle. It only exists to be modified really. It's going to be modified, you know, every week, every month, every day, sometimes."

            {
                "speaker": "Speaker-3",
                "content": "Yeah, we called.That future perk in our platform and we really feel like the operator deserves a future proof system, whether it be.The actual payload integrations or the airframe itself and so.And those edits will be able to be able to be made and sent forward. So it's pretty exciting for us. Again, like slide breath, if you don't mind.Guys, so you guys get you know pictures from companies all the time this is how we see the industry really the industry has locked in designs but they've also locked in payloads and optimizations and so our our goal is to be able to swap propulsion types integrations, endless integrations and then really ramp up that production volume to meet the demand vendor lock is another big one that you know all of the service members on this call have experienced and what we want to do is have a completely open architecture we.The most of principles a few years ago and really applied them to how we approach this product and future products. So open architecture is in our in our DNA and then really every system should be multi mission and believe that strongly. And so having a lower ammunition is cool because that's what we knew. But as we grow from the TTPS and lessons learned in Ukraine, we're applying that to a system that really can do multi missions can be recoverable can be one way, but it really is choose your adventure and then high.So we're driving costs down significantly. We'll get to the specifics, but I will tell you we're depending on the day, we can either be 1/5 of the cost or a third depending on what integrations you need. Next slide.Mr. Berg, you see it's got a pusher prop in the back if you get the next slide from your Brett. I don't like the slide that much. This one I like is because he had an off and on sections on top. We're swapping propulsion just like a Lego set. And So what that's allowing is one way attack jets, that's allowing pusher prop and then it's also allowing a battery EDF. And so we're basically taking the widest approach to the mission, you know, kind of vignettes that the service.Providing us and saying how do we get after it with one aircraft that's significant within the test community. But on the operational side, if you have it all in that box right there and you're able to, you know, fly a long duration, I starting mission for 12 hours with a nice bra and then switch that up quickly to running, you know, diesel within a turbojet. We bring a lot of options to the table and so that's pretty exciting.Next slide.I'll just run through these pretty quick and kind of get to the conversation, which is what I'm interested in. And so these group ones, well, the Group 1 space is crowded, especially you're talking quadcopters when you're talking in, you know, one way attack with Group One with a potentially thrust vector, you know, controlled back ends and allowing this to be not only a precision strike, you know, attack enabled and then also interceptor for counter US, we open up a completely different portfolio. This can print basically hand in hand with The Tempest.And so as we're printing in Excel, we're potentially putting interceptors and the price per shot in these is significantly cheaper than what the DoD is currently fielding. And we're making these backpackable. So we look at these, you know, proliferated and replacing ET fours, replacing javelins, but really being tack enabled and then also storm capable. And so right now with our Tempest birds, we're swarming those systems. We did that recently at at two test events.Successfully, we'll keep in this form bigger and bigger, we'll keep adapting to other people's AI payloads that they want if they're if they're affordable. But that same principle apply to El Nino. So it's pretty exciting. Excellent.Archer Universal Flight Controller, we're looking at how do we do mission management off of this board and basically you plug and play the systems you want. You won't do everything. And right now what we're doing is we're building out the the SDKS to allow you guys to plug the sensors in you want. Essentially some of those are classified sensors or or payloads that we don't need to know about. We just want to give you the access to this board to integration. Next slide.Is there LBC? Everyone's got something special within VR.But what this is for us is lethality creation for the warhead and payloads. But it's also mission planning for not only defensive capabilities, but also offensive. And so this allows to do mission planning either as a SIM. There's a beta version right now working on this out of pocket. This is something that I really think can be taken to the next level with some DoD support. Excellent.Next line.Yeah, this is the, you know what we're talking about when we're talking manufacturing at the edge right now. There's a lot of interest within a lot of the foreign countries to be self-sufficient, especially within the drones, drone space. They want to print their, you know, their flags on the back tail section. So we want to enable that also for USDOD. We want to basically do operational prep of the environment with these systems having staged a very innocuous and print on demand as conflict arises.And next slide?The road map, El Nino is probably a TRL 4-5, probably jump up to A7 pretty quick. Tempest is pretty high TRL, and that's what we're flying daily. And then our aspirations are to build up to the Torrent 250, get a little bit longer distance, more payload against some of those other mission spaces that the attempts can't. But yeah, we can kill the sludge of bread and we can hopefully have a good conversation."

And so we need to make sure that we're tapping into what Navy and what Army care about, and it can't just be a one trick pony for the Air Force. And so that's why I'm excited about this."

And so that may be something that could be a possible discussion.It's no cost to the companies. We're just doing it to get capability faster. So that's why I'm investing in it. And we've got partnered up with the DoD to run the Joint Interagency Field Experimentation at Camp Roberts here in California that's administered by Naval Postgraduate School.And then so Brian, I don't know your thoughts.On that and other applications that you've seen, you know from your your time in the tech space.What do you?"

I've got a bunch of other questions. Maybe that I'll, I'll, I'll look in them just from my power requirements.Like those kinds of things above the sea, but I'm sure they're all on the website somewhere I can find if you guys mentioned you guys are out for a round to if you guys have an investor deck.

I would tell you that, you know, our goal is to make the system, you know, operator proof, right? And so we're trying to ensure that we're not creating more UAS pilots for the DoD. I think that that's a significant, you know, kind of burden on the cognitive load that we keep talking about with operators and so.And right now our bird is is autonomous takeoff and landing. We put navigation and flying itself. That Storm Flew was choreographed, but it was, you know, making those corrections itself to that AI.You know, autopilot and so we're getting we're getting closer and closer to making this a plug and play system for operators. Really what we want to see is we want to see that payload swap happen. We want to see you guys come to us and say, hey, this is the radio. Does it plug and play? Once we do that, we want to fly it and bring it back. But EW system on fly it, bring it back and they go do a one way attack and then really the culmination of our company.Within this space would be for us to have our excel delivered out to a site. You print a drone, you weaponize a drone, you strike a target and and really that's going to that's going to unlock kind of the the the Pandora's box for DoD to start getting into these systems and putting them on ships and then also printing more than just our drones. And so I think that's going to be exciting. We've been offered and and Brian, maybe you're tracking this and, and Troy, probably, you know within your portfolio as well.But Balakotan is big exercise. We've been doing the Philippines next year. It's been brought up to us just kind of it's been socialized with us that shotgun Browning Ousd like to see us deploy capability and do just that to get there. There's a lot of stuff to have to take place. And Brian, you know, you're obviously pretty astute within this, you know, world. It wasn't Troy the cost associated with it. But then also all of the the RF is right. Like what are we trying to achieve?And what are our critical criteria for these exercises to be validated?So Brett, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that as well, man, because I know you stare at this and you know what the friction points are."

So and then obviously the Army's got a big hit and and interested in how our technologies address contest logistics problems.And so there's a lot of, you know, that's a shotgun blast, but that this is kind of how we.We think about how our products align with not just DoD, you know, service strategy, but DoD at large. And Troy, you mentioned replicator, right? So you know, I think we were replicated before it was a thing right before Secretary Hicks announced it, right? We talked about low cost, trivial mass like that's what we that's what our company does.And with respect to Tabolic 10, absolutely. Like that's a heavy lift, right? We talked about, you know, logistically moving.Excels even though they're transportable by air, sea and land, you know, that's a big lift again for a small business to come out of pocket to do to get that into the end of pickup theater to support that exercise. So, but understanding the the overall intent, the objectives, what's going to get us to that next step right with with the the government, I think those would be interesting areas that we'd ask for your your guidance and assistance so.Yeah, I love it."

We partnered with some great OEMs, but it is expensive. And Brian to your point like some of the the cost, the largest cost is associated with range time, right and get on the right ranges kind of like Dugway and all those spots are great, but you have to have the demand signal from the DoD and so that would be huge. I do want to call a couple things. One, Ian's been doing some testing with Afro RX, which is the materials branch of AFRL.And doing EMI testing. And so our aircraft was very resistant within an EMI environment. They tested range which stuff we can't get into this call. But really the the results of that you guys could get on the high side if you guys requested it and see what this thing is capable of doing within a really dense environment.And then the last thing I want to do, I wanted to make sure that Matt gets a chance to correct anything that I'm missing here.Kind of within the Navy portfolio of things that maybe we should be asking.

Air Force has been an early adopter and all that stuff. A lot of it's come from autonomy prime our relationship with, you know, fit into a family of systems. Some of that AI enabled functions, some of it is, is real just true hardware and and scale.Umm right now we are working with Indo Pacom we're the number one priority coming out into Paycom for for the app and push for ousc. So hopefully we'll have success there, but but choice your point with replicator, it's a dogfight right? And you know everyone thinks it's going to be this windfall of cash. We really want to be part of the solution because we think that it's truly unique and it fits really well, but we'll need some help with that and so.I don't want to come to you guys and ask for cash. That's that's too easy.

Like we just did a big exercise where they basically took everything, all the blue listed drones and took them out. And we're still doing a series of tests with those. But the initial test was like how quick can you get them? Take an operator that's let's say 0 little to no knowledge and get it up in the air and go out and hit a target.With some space floating around and how easy is it to use those kinds of things? How easy was it to get out-of-the-box all those. It's kind of evaluated some stuff like that, You know, we could get some guys to buy some of those, run it through those kinds of things, we could do some other ones, but.You know, it sounds like orders would help and then that'll help you raise too, right? You can show that some of the DoD is buying these things. We've got a contract that helps raise money.Yeah, I think the other one question is a little bit of.A side note, how about for integration with the systems that are out there in the field right now?

So this just out-of-the-box and then was just even tied in with chat earlier this morning about like MP Fives and some of the other kind of common mesh networks already out there.So yeah, and most groups haven't even gotten they're like, I don't even know what's out there to deal with. So where do we even do that one? So that's great. OK, cool. I'd say another one just to kind of follow in which I was talking about is like sometimes the path of least resistance is the easiest way. And sometimes until we until folks have their requirements and know what they want, like things like our vehicle as a as a target drone or as just something to kind of fly around in red team I think is really interesting.It can be done for a really low cost as well. But if you want to fly something that's kind of fast, like we were talking to some army guys that just got back from Syria where the the flying wing shaheeds that go pretty damn fast, like 200 miles an hour. We're hitting bases in Syria and they were, you know, there's stuff out there to shoot them down for sure, but it just presents kind of like an asymmetric, you know, thing. And so we have a vehicle that's kind of that same, you know, flight category everywhere from like, you know, 5055 miles an hour.All the way up to like plus 200 miles an hour, you know, So you just present something a different look for, for, you know, CUS systems out there, whether it's CW or kinetic or whatever."

So I should be on most of the planning calls now.If not, let's talk and then whatever we can't fit in up there.Let's figure out how we can fit that in for you guys, because if you want, we can just go out over the water and do whatever you want. And we have.Speaking of range time chat, you brought up the cost of range time. So we also as a, as a tech bridge community, we're we're getting standard range time. It should be like once per month. We should be able to go out to China Lake and they're going to carve out like four or five days. You might have to tack into some other exercises or just kind of dance with the time card on that. But we should have time out there to be able to do pretty much whatever the hell he wants, just dry lake bed and they're going to be like.You guys can do it. We've been doing it for a long time. So they'll just like kind of let us run unless we need their help or want to tie into systems out there, then we kind of get to do whatever we want.

If you could help on the TIU side for blue US that would be enormous for us, the swamp company and then you know, we talked about potentially extractor. I'd like to learn more with Brett and the team, but really just starting the dance that you guys and it sounds like you guys are connected across a pretty huge swath of capabilities and so.You know, I would like to keep feeding the information.As long as it's not annoying to you and make sure you see the developments that Ian's talking about. We're on contract with CLT, you know, launch system. Brian, I can't understand. We have sold systems into the DoD. We sold them to AFSO, we sold them to up the system up in Rome, NY. SMXONR is quite a few. And so, but I don't want to oversell the hands. And so we've also have systems overseas in Ukraine and so.We've got 5 systems that are on the deck out there outside of heath so.We're making progress, but we certainly can use all the support we can get from connected folks."

Let's all go, you know, show, show, enforce there and go see some of these.Capabilities for sure. So and if not, I think you know what I want to work with the GFX team in a little bit more on maybe like videoing, recording and trying to bring it back for those who can't get out there. I know that sometimes it's hard to know what we're doing, but same thing we're out on boats, right? But just bringing that back. That's where that Navy tech connect will come in Troy, right? We'll, we'll film it, put it and turn it a little bit of a call it a podcast, for lack of a better word, but it's just just the capabilities briefed by, by video.Yeah, yeah. So definitely."

The the test that we just did out on Noah's boat, Trevor was there showed that that that the unsexy stuff is what's tricking up a lot of companies, right. When I get out-of-the-box, can I fire it up? Will it work? We had to be honest with you guys. We had how many? I think they had eight or nine of the blue Uas.Listen, didn't workout of the box. It took us like 2 weeks to reconfigure, get software downloaded. Like once we got it up and running, people couldn't operate it like it. And then when it finally operated like it wouldn't, you know, hold position, it wouldn't do things with it. And those are the things that we're starting to find as, as as we buy these and get them out there that are just like it looks cool and we, it has a really good capability, but it's useless like if you can't use it. Yeah, we had to have.Top, top operators like one of the guys flies. What was he?"

And I think the unsexy stuff and answering those basic questions, can I get enough of them? Are they easy to use? Do I have enough parts? Like those are the kinds of things. And then those things really stick out because, you know, some of those things just never even got tested because we just couldn't get them in the air.So the kind of answer your question is kind of round about.Those things start to show better than the other stuff and people start to take notice because like, man, this is so much easier. I'd much rather deal with this than the other ones. And, and they kind of self promote and people see those and then they want them back. Or to be honest with you, they they last through the next test and the next one and the next one, they just keep showing up. We had four or five tests and we're going to do another round of them. So they don't even like three of them aren't even going to make it. We're not even going to deal with them.So I think you know, just some of the basics help show really well and keep you in the in the.Kind of in the show and people start to see those and then people talk. So that one I don't know what we can share a troll with where that knowledge is going to go up to you know better than I on what was on financial or not. But that that testing that we did went up to some pretty big groups making big decisions with on a on a large magnitude right.
