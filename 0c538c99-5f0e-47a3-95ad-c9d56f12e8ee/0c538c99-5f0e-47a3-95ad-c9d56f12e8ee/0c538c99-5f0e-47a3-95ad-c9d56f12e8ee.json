                "content": "If you don't agree with them, they let your voice be heard. So we talked about at the last tech, which quarterly and at the PMR followed shortly after that, that we now combine the two things into one meeting. What they like to do for you. That came from the tech rates directors. What data can do for us is where you ask. We took all those comments that you can put in there and say that we bubble them up into those 4 high level things. Communication plan, strategies, enhance transparency, access enabled.Content and vibration across temperature network. So we're not perfect obviously yet, but I think we make some pretty good progress over the course of the last six months.The repurposing, they like weekly meetings. The weekly meeting at 10:30 East Coast time I think has been beneficial for everybody. If you if you have comments about that meeting, you will see one of the different things in that meeting and let's have that conversation this week. This is the time to have that conversation to adjust and work that meeting.It is something that is we're rolling through the week if weeks go by so fast, right? It feels like to me like I'm like chronic, I do those slides again, right, so.It just comes out really quickly every week, so it's a good time to communicate and talk. If there's not as much preparation for it, at least let's communicate and talk during that hour, hour and a half that we have, OK?It's going to kick off mid year and end of your meetings. OK, we got us. We're doing so this is the kickoff for FY25.The goal of this meeting is to have discussions about, OK, so you know what your budgets are for the most part, right? I think you got your plans laid down for 25. You know what you accomplished in 24 for the most part, right? You still need to Click to some of that data. But this discussion we're going to have this week is, is OK, we're kicking off. Let's make sure everybody knows what you're doing in 25. Let's make sure there's any coordination required. We've nailed that down.And we're and we're making that clear to make sure across the team, the whole package network in the in the Naval XT.And and then the next one we'll have is the six month mark into the fiscal year. So that'll be sometime in the March, April time frame is why something you do. We'll negotiate that time and that place here on probably Thursday, right. So think about if you're a tech race director and you really want the whole team to come to your tech bridge, then start putting your doing your little secret balloting around around the group. All right, That's what Linda and Julie did last time and they got voted to be.Hose so if you want to cause to come to you start working at this week, OK, that's all that and that will be the six month mark and that mark that that point will be OK. We're halfway through the fiscal year. What have we accomplished and then what are we going to finish out until the end of the fiscal year, right. So that's the next goal of the mid of the mid year meeting. Are we going to do quarterly tech bridge summit meetings?Let's have that conversation because I think personally, my recognition is they go away.At the quarterly level I think it comes too fast and I think and I think the weekly meetings and other communication we're doing are clear are good clearing house for those things. I think we just stay on with a semi annual you know and make it a week long thing, right. We have this discussion overall. So let's have a discussion this week and come up with a plan. If the temperature say mutiny on that and say no, we need a quarterly meeting then I have to let's just make sure.From naval perspective, we'll do the program review component of it every six months, OK.Contact list update OK, So what I've done is we have using the flank speed stuff, we've got the the tech bridge directors at USDOT Navy dot mill that carries everybody in the tech, all the techniques directors and a few of the contract support and me. So when we send those out, that's you at your district list. We also have an iOS MA like tech 4 is iosm e-mail address.That has all the all those folks on it as well.We have a Natalie headquarters 1. So those are done through the flank speed group basically. So you have in your in your inbox in your outlook, you should have you should be logged into that group on the shows up on the bottom of your left hand side. If you are a non blank DP person and we we do all hands are all technically just type of stuff. We are keeping the distro list on inside of teams. It's on a it's not a one note page. And So what the admin folks do who Natalie and Janet and.Do is the captain when we send it all hands and we just cut and paste those right into the e-mail. So we'll do checkers, directors, IOSM, new excite quarters, cut and paste everybody else into that. If you're not getting, if you're if you're not on that e-mail list or you haven't been receiving those things, make sure that you have your e-mail capture on that in that page, OK.Because I, I've tried really hard to get everybody I thought in there, they need to be in there included Kapias and that we that, that and that conversation about the pee is something at the tech bridge level from the tech bridge director. Some tech bridge directors like I don't really want my Pennsylvania to get all the information all the time, right. I'd rather be the person that kind of help distribute that information to the piece. And that's fun. That's you, your tech Ridge. You manage that. Others are like, no, no, I want that director to go to my PS as well. All right, so that's.Something that you negotiate individually and bring that to Natalie, Janet and I will add those emails in.OK. So that's how we're doing the contact list. If there's any way to improve that, let us know. OK, But I thought we were doing it right now.Google IO 4 shared calendar data storage that's brand new as of the last month. So Mike Popola, where you at? There he is. Look at his bug over there. Decode and and Roberto, is there a decode? OK, So they're the guys doing all this admin trying to keep us straight across the tech bridge network on the Naval XI, OK.You're not getting something from finally answering your e-mail. Ping those guys, right? If I'm maybe I'm stuck somewhere else, right? If you need help with the calendar, go get those guys. If you need anything from headquarters at all and, and, and some reason I'm not paying attention, then please reach out to those guys. All right, and the calendar here start putting your events on there. So one of the questions we had was how do I know all the other tech bridges are doing?From a day-to-day, minute by minute. So everybody should be able to go log into the Google and share the calendar now.And and see what everybody else is doing, but please add your event against not, not not everything is there yet, right? So I get your accounts, log in and put your stuff in. If you need Mike and reversal to help you put those things in to send the list of stuff in the dates, they'll put it in for you. OK, So PS policy loan and centralized repository, that's all in that Google IO4. Also the state of this of the of the Salesforce site is going to be a game changer for all of us. I think we've been waiting for this for a long time.Thank you for your patience. But I think we're getting there. We're on five of step five of five and so of the Ato process for the Aisle 4 environment. And, and we've been gathering information and data and throwing it in there right out to kind of get up to speed. Somebody goes live, but some of you have accounts and you're inside of it to kind of looking around. Then we go to Aisle 4 and then we're going to start moving everything kind of into that Salesforce environment, OK. And that'll be the transition over the next six months.From when it comes up, right. So be prepared for that when it's coming to end up again.Dave Bigelow is the main guy driving that. There's also a whole digital environment that that Dave is lining up with DIU. So DIU looked at what we were doing across today's whole plan. They're like, yeah, we like that. We're going to do that, right? So he's actually on a nine month or six months kind of thing now with DIU helping them every day with their environment. That's going to become the dice environment that they should call it, right? That we're all going to all going to use and leverage so we can see everything that's going across.Across all the entities in the dice, right? So that's what's coming here is hopefully in 25, right? We'll see how fast that goes and see how much reality we get out of this because we all know how those things work, right? But be hopeful, All right, in process trading, Salesforce tech bridge charter, OK, I have the tech bridge charter and I got all your inputs and then I took it those inputs and I added some edits into it as well.Ray felt like my edits might have been.Something that kind of counters some of the inputs. And so I'm going to send it back out to you. Just one quick look, right. Just tell me what if, if, if anything in there you totally are got heartburn with once it comes back, then hey, we don't think we're good with this. And what I try to do is there was intersections about. I try to do more of a tie in with T2 and orders and and tech bridges in the charter than it was. I mean, I make a little bit stronger connection than I think it was already there. And there was also a pieces in there about.That I that I kind of edited a little bit and, and, and we're between the command relationship of, of, of the warfare center and the.Because there's guidance from 878 that we don't want the tech bridges to be the center of gravity, to be the war for center necessarily. We want it to be the tech bridge, right? And the 4% is really the the where we do, where the tech transfer functions are.The CTO functions are the statutes, the command functions are in terms of like contracting and financial and things like that. But our, but our our place out in town where people can go without having a cat card and things like that. That's kind of a central gravity of all this is like gravity of the whole thing. So I try to like kind of add my thoughts in about that into the temperature.And but I still have, you know, CNR down to down to Naval X on the org chart. Naval X is across from the.Is across from the the ward for center command basically, but 06/06 relationship, right. And then from there tech bridges and then all the 40 functions of the things that we do right in that in that in that chart. So we did that.What? I'll send it to everybody. Yeah, yeah."

So the legal folks in ONR are pushing back hard on that. So we talked to Admiral Papano about that and we need to follow up with him potentially seeing he can push that pillar to know now under the CNR, but now OK, so are we.Now are we like a little mini PEO that's kind of going to Asnrda as well as going to our system kind of kind of relationship at this point, you know, we've been told, hey, you need to build that relationship with your with with CNR, right and.It's a balancing act. So what I got in there right now is CNR, OK. And I think it's it's understood in the dotted line to ASMRDA for now, OK. And we're going to we're going to keep working on that relationship as we go forward.That makes sense."

So then that's where OK, now it makes sense where Naval access, OK, it is O&R. That's what 1R we follow policies and file procedures.Our connection with ASN where it was before is not the same. So we're working through that. Admiral Papano, when we briefed them at the boardroom, basically came back and said, hey, we need to redo these charters.And that's where we can influence it. So we're still working through that on. Does it make sense to have that connection? If so, what does that connection look like? And if not, what impact does that have? So I."

But I but one of the things that when the knife thing came down and was and was proposed and then put in the in the black and white, I was first. I was like, oh, great. Yeah. But I thought about it. I'm like, wait a minute.As an O6 command.Lorna Oregon 6 organization, we're not going to be able to do a huge a lot of influence unless we have somebody in command at a flag level who's our champion. I mean think about that, right and so having a two star CNR, which is the other major S1 command doing major things in the Navy other than the CNL is a pretty powerful platform to be under right and so really.How do we get the C&R to C and understand what we're trying to do?And be able to make those SRA decisions to actually resource it and be our champion in that regard. I think it's that's a huge trust that the captain and I are trying to work with CNR on. OK. And it's it's there of course are challenges like in any type of relationship. But that's why, you know, like, for example, I'm back in the backroom, you know, in the back of the movie, you say talking to Doctor pilot, who's a lot of influence with the executive director, Doctor Fu, new executive director Owen R right. And and with the Admiral.OK. And I've been on a phone call with with Doctor Pollock in the last month, basically candidates I can get. Mike, where do you think we're going with this? I need your advocacy inside O&R, right. And we're trying to push those things along and then move the Admiral in the direction we needed to go. Yeah."

The way CNR describes tablets was just part part of it, very thin layer of this kind of connecting thing.But I daunted me that maybe the the rest of the.Tools that we bring to bear aren't really within, to your point, Scott, earlier of the off site. It's not really stuff that Eleanor thinks about like fueling technology in the near term, within the next, you know, 12 to 16 months. So that is stuff that ASN is thinking about, you know, with the Zuma off site with ASN have more of an avalanche connection to say, look, this is where the PS are going. This is where all the tool sets you bring to bear where O&R just falls on deaf ears because they're like I'm doing.Working with universities, I mean, I've had two of them are program leads. Basically. I don't work with programs. They're not around logging out for me. So I'm like, oh, well, we're sort of in a mismatch of like, you don't want the the people that I'm talking to. I got it. So, you know, maybe maybe that even the POS and this and our new folks are more like, yeah, we're looking for those kinds of things."

Captain Tarp got up and briefed T2 and he's all excited in the last two weeks that he found the 20/23/2023 T 2.And your report. And he's just like, look at this program. Look what it does. They look at all this stuff and it's like, it's like they're like kids in the candy store. They found this new thing that he's sharing with everybody in the room. And of course Ray is listening to singing. He's like, he's like, why is he briefing our stuff? And I'm like, chill, chill, right?So there are and then I was in a meeting with the CNR about 3 weeks ago.And it was one of those whenever our Loe updates in him and cat was still on leave and it's incremental progress, right? And so he started to ask me questions in his mind. He got these tech bridge things and were enabling. But then I but we started getting down into questions about, well, how do you transition technology? How do you do integration and who's going to do that? And how do I improve my transition of my programs? And then he's is my see, his mind started open a little bit, right?So it's coming, it's incremental, we're getting there, right? And Maria's not here right now, but I'm glad she's here because I'm going to bend her ear big time for the next year and a half. All right, all right, so those are the actresses.

I'm trying to keep it updated, right and.Only had access to the iOS and one so he can add you into that.Next slide.I think next slide is kind of the same. It's like the list of the of the of the of the specific ones, right. So this is what each action kind of was how they grouped into the four and then the status of them for the most part. So you see we're getting I think to the complete on a lot of these. Some are in process. I think the meeting process is to go forward in six months as well.All right.Next slide. All right, actions are done. Anybody got anything else? So we'll collect an actions from this meeting. Who's collecting actions badly and Dina?"

So like the Naval X problem set that know them and that team is working on will be able to run that against the latest research that's being done and published.

His his first thing he's going to do is I, I went to talk to Kim Foles who's a lead legal counsel at O&R and she is very helpful and very supportive. And so I've got her two legal counsels, her IP lead and her key to lead are going to go with him.He's going to be calling you and he's going to be bringing them to you and we need you to interviewing with you and talking about your challenges, troubles and trials, everything that you've got going on that or, or things that might be working right.

And Linda, if you were about to.So these squad charts, by design, it is a quick snapshot of your ecosystem, the tech bridge, the PETA partners and other partners you might have working with you. So by design, it's a quad chart, finite amount of space. And we gave everybody 15 minutes just to really share the important highlights, not to go into the weeds. Some of you got creative. Aaron Baker, I'm looking at you.And and gave me a quad chart plus another bunch of slides. All of the slides are in the slide deck. I think the additional slides I just hidden, so hopefully we'll talk to them. Maybe whoever's running the slides can unhide them for you.We roughly went to look at the map, we roughly went from east to West. So the first Tech Bridge is London. I believe Jeff Brewer is on the line to talk to his slides to start. And if he's not, we can, we can do our best to read them. So with that, Jeff Brewer, do we have you and Linda? Anything else you want to add to that? No, no, just the London 1. I don't know if Jeff's online."
